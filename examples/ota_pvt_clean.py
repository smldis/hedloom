"""The OTA/PVT study reduced to the simulation path, with a written deliverable.

    .toolchain/venv/bin/python hedloom/examples/ota_pvt_clean.py [--fresh]

`ota_pvt.py` carries the whole reference, structural analysis included. This is
the same study with SPICE Canonical and Netlist Decomposition removed, leaving
what a PVT sign-off actually is: render the corners, simulate them, measure
them, check them against limits, and hand someone a report.

Two things differ beyond the deletions.

**Sidecar fans out, not the flow.** The corners are not written here. They are
read from the edit file's own ``PARAM_SETS`` at authoring time, expanded through
sidecar's own ``expand_param_matrix``, and rendered by a *single* ``prepare``
invocation. The edit file is the one place a corner is declared; adding one
there adds it to the study.

The trade is real and worth stating: one invocation that renders every corner is
one unit of reuse. Editing a single corner's parameters re-renders all of them,
where `ota_pvt.py`'s per-corner prepare re-rendered only the corner that moved.
Simulation is where the time goes and that stays per corner either way, so this
is cheap here — but on a study whose rendering is expensive it would not be.

**It writes a deliverable.** ``report.md`` is the artifact a person is given:
the verdict, the corner table, the limits applied, and the provenance —
including each declared source's content fingerprint, so the report says which
inputs produced it rather than asserting a date.

**It runs on Dask.** This is the one example that does. A `LocalCluster` is
built here rather than inside `submit`, because how many corners a site
tolerates at once is an operational fact and a library choosing it silently
would be choosing wrong somewhere. The corners then run concurrently instead of
one after another, and the dashboard — opened before submission, since the
sweep outlives a browser launch by only a few seconds — shows which corner is
running under its authored key.

Reuse and watching pull against each other, which is worth understanding rather
than working around: a second run of an unchanged study reuses every record,
never calls a body, and is over before the browser repaints. That is the system
working. `--fresh` runs against records nothing has written yet when what you
want is to watch, and leaves the existing ones alone.

That dashboard needs `bokeh`, which the units deliberately do not depend on, so
this example is run through the project-local `.toolchain/venv` described in
`.toolchain/README.md`. The study itself is unchanged: the same Plan, the same
identities, the same reuse. Only readiness moved.
