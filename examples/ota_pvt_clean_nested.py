"""The corner set is a result — and the corners are still invocations.

    python examples/ota_pvt_clean_nested.py

`ota_pvt_clean.py` reads the edit file while authoring, so the Plan can name one
simulation per corner. Moving that read into the graph makes the corner list a
*result*, and a Plan states what will run before anything runs — so the outer
plan cannot name them.

The way out is not to give up the fan-out. It is to stop assuming one plan:

    described = load_edit_file(edits)     # operation 1
    jobs      = expand_jobs(described)    # operation 2
    result    = run_corner_study(jobs, …) # operation 3 — authors a Plan and runs it

`run_corner_study` is one invocation of the outer plan. Inside it, the jobs are
an ordinary Python value, so it authors a second Plan that names one prepare,
one simulate and one measure *per corner*, and submits it. Per-corner identity,
placement, reuse and observability all come back — they belong to the inner
plan, which is complete and inspectable before it spends anything, exactly like
the outer one.

Nothing here is result-dependent control. No plan branches on its own results.
Plans are *staged*: each one is fully determined at the moment it is authored,
and the later stage is authored after the earlier stage has produced its
values. The invariant holds per plan, which is where it was always stated.

What this buys over collapsing the fan-out into monolithic operations:

* each corner is its own attempt. Tightening a spec limit reruns the outer
  `corners` invocation, which re-authors stage two — and stage two then reuses
  nine of its ten invocations, running only the evaluation. Every simulation
  survives a change to the thing that judges simulations.
* each corner can take its own placement, because `simulate_ac` returns
  `shell(...)` again and the inner run binds it;
* the inner plan document is a declared output of the outer invocation, so what
  the second stage decided to run is recorded rather than inferred.

What it does *not* buy, measured rather than assumed: **adding a corner still
reruns every corner.** `prepare_corner` declares the edit file as an input, a
source is fingerprinted whole, and that file carries two independent things —
which corners exist, and how every corner is edited. Adding a corner changes the
fingerprint, so the system correctly concludes that every corner's render might
have changed. It is right; the declaration is too coarse.

The staged shape is where that becomes fixable, which is worth noticing. `load_
edit_file` already separates the param sets from the rest of the file. If
stage two's corners depended on the *edit recipe* rather than on the file that
carries it, adding a corner would leave the others alone. Nothing here does that
yet — it needs a way to declare "this part of that source", which does not
exist.

The wart, stated rather than hidden: the inner records root arrives as config,
which puts a machine path into the outer plan's identity. An operation that
runs a study needs to know its site, and today the only way to tell it is to
author the answer. See `docs/vision/open-concepts.md`.
