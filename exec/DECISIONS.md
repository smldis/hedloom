# Hedloom Exec decision ledger

This file replaces the per-phase work-order sequence used through Hedloom Flow
Phases 1–5. It is a living ledger, not an authorization record: it says what is
settled, what is open, and what observation would change each answer. The code
and its tests are the evidence.

## Recorded process revision (2026-08-03)

The graduated main adopted allocation policy 3, "a reviewed evidence work
order," as the default while the architecture was provisional, and explicitly
made that policy falsifiable: *"Reassess it when repeated reviews add ceremony
without changing scope."*

**Observation.** Across Hedloom Flow Phases 1–5 the policy produced roughly 1,700
lines of governance around 3,171 lines of source, a paired plan commit and
feature commit per phase, and an independent reviewer pass per phase, while the
component still could not execute a single operation. The ceremony grew; the
scope per slice did not.

**Revision.** Direct human-reviewed development against this ledger, with
review at natural boundaries rather than per phase. What is retained from the
prior policy, because it was the part that worked: falsifiable framing, named
discriminating observations, honest ontologies, and the refusal to let passing
tests silently graduate architecture. What is dropped: work-order identities,
authorization records, stop-condition recitals, and delegated review panes.

This revision is recorded rather than drifted into, as the main requires.

### Amendment (2026-08-03): what the two real errors taught

Two substantive errors have occurred in this line of work, with opposite
shapes, and neither is explained by "not enough reasoning per step".

*The detached-lifetime premise* — that an accepted job outlives its submitter —
was produced by the heavy dialectic workflow, argued at length in the graduated
main, and survived reviewer passes. It was falsified by one sentence of user
direction. Depth did not catch it; contact with the requirement did.

*The unsound reuse default* — `RECORDED` returning results computed from
different inputs — was produced by the light workflow, flagged in the same
message that shipped it, recorded in the ontology, and fixed two turns later.
The reasoning happened; the shipping decision was wrong.

The corrective is therefore not more ceremony, and not deeper per-step review.
It is two cheap rules, now in `AGENTS.md`: incompleteness must refuse rather
than answer wrongly, and the invariant gets stated in one sentence before the
surface is written. Adversarial review is reserved for finished slices, where
it finds things, rather than applied per increment, where it mostly restates
what the increment already claims about itself.

## Premise correction (2026-08-03, user direction)

The unit was built on the architecture's lifetime asymmetry: an accepted batch
job outlives the process that submitted it, so a transient handle cannot own
its identity. **The user has stated the opposite as the design intent — a job
is not supposed to outlive its owner, and a caller crash should take the work
down with it.**

This removes the premise of the graduated main's provisional decision that "an
attempt protocol owns LSF." With owner-bound lifetime, the unsafe transition
that argument was built to survive becomes a defect to prevent rather than a
state to reconcile, and Dask owning the lifecycle is no longer unsound on
lifetime grounds.

**What the failure mode becomes.** Duplicate prevention is replaced by orphan
prevention. The indeterminate-submission window still exists and still matters,
but the correct response inverts: from "refuse to guess, wait to attach" to
"discover it and kill it." Lookup by a pre-chosen unique identity is therefore
still a required site capability, used for reaping rather than attaching, and
identity uniqueness matters more than before because the action it enables is
destructive.

**What enforces it.** An expectation is not a mechanism; unenforced owner-bound
lifetime is how orphans happen. `dask-jobqueue` already implements this for
pooled workers via `--death-timeout` plus `bkill` on cluster close, so pooled
mode should adopt it rather than rebuild it. Direct mode should borrow the same
discipline. Enforcement must not depend on `bsub -I`: the manifesto forbids
authority living in an interactive session, and a lease works identically for a
terminal, a script, CI, or an agent.

**What "resume" means here.** Not reattaching to running work, which no longer
exists. The manifesto's actual requirement is to rerun from a clean environment
without repeating results whose inputs remain valid. That is result reuse and
staleness, and it is the durable record's real purpose in this design —
evidence and reuse, not recovery.

**Consequence for this unit.** Attempt identity, the append-only journal, atomic
terminal publication, the refused/indeterminate distinction, and reconciliation
all survive with changed justifications. The attach disposition and
`UnrecoverableAttempt` are demoted: they are correct only for a transport that
declares detached lifetime, and no such transport exists or is currently wanted.
They are retained, unreachable by default, rather than deleted, because the
distinction they encode is what makes the orphan-reaping path expressible.

## Settled by evidence in this unit

| Question | Answer | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Can a durable record own external attempt identity? | Yes, if identity is chosen before submission. | `test_acceptance_to_receipt_loss_attaches_and_never_duplicates` — one job, one run, after a lost receipt across a restart. |
| What must a site provide for recoverable execution? | Either atomic acceptance-to-receipt, or lookup by an identity chosen beforehand. | `test_acceptance_to_receipt_loss_fails_loudly_without_discovery` — absent both, `UnrecoverableAttempt`. |
| Is a non-authoritative discovery useless? | No. Only the negative answer needs authority. | `test_a_positive_discovery_is_usable_even_without_authority`. |
| Does a transport exception mean the work was refused? | No. Only `SubmissionRefused` establishes that; everything else holds the attempt in the crash window. | `test_indeterminate_submission_blocks_a_blind_resubmission`. |
| Does recovery require graph topology? | No. | `test_recovery_needs_no_knowledge_of_the_graph` — recovery succeeds from a bundle carrying no dependency information. |
| Can cancellation be known? | No, only intended and later reconciled. | `test_success_after_requested_cancellation_is_not_normalized`. |
| Does placement belong in result identity? | No. Queue, walltime, cores and host are excluded, so retuning resources never invalidates a result. | `test_placement_does_not_participate_in_identity`, and `test_retuning_the_resource_request_still_reuses_the_result` now that options actually reach the job. |
| Whose resource request is it? | The invocation's. One transport resolves each submission over its site defaults, so a cheap extraction and a large-memory corner can share it. | `test_one_transport_serves_invocations_with_different_needs`; end to end through a real `bsub` argument list in `hedloom-run`'s `test_an_authored_resource_need_survives_all_the_way_to_the_submission`. |
| What happens to an option a transport cannot express? | It refuses before submission. Dropping a stated resource need would run the work under conditions nobody asked for, which is the silent-wrongness rule applied to placement. | `test_an_option_this_transport_cannot_express_is_refused`, `test_a_misspelled_option_does_not_silently_run_anywhere`. |
| Who arbitrates a simulator licence? | LSF. A declared `licences={"name": n}` becomes a `rusage` term on that job; nothing here counts tokens or waits for one, because the scheduler owns the count. | `test_a_declared_licence_becomes_a_request_on_that_job`. The site's resource *names* are a fact to ask for, not derive. |
| Can reuse return a result from different inputs? | No, once identity is content-addressed: changed inputs land on a different attempt. | `test_changed_inputs_do_not_reuse_the_old_result`. |
| May a failed result be reused? | Not automatically. It is retained, the rerun takes a new sequence, and a human may accept it after inspection. | `test_a_failure_is_not_reused_and_the_work_runs_again`, `test_an_accepted_failure_is_reused_afterwards`. |
| What happens to superseded results? | They are retained and nameable as stale, not overwritten. | `test_prior_results_are_named_as_superseded_not_discarded`. |
| How should the two units couple? | Through the Plan document, not the package. Neither imports the other. | `planned.py` reads plain data; `test_the_real_hedloom_flow_example_plan_derives` runs against a Plan Hedloom Flow actually produced. |
| Does staleness propagate transitively? | Yes. Editing one corner reruns it and its reduction while siblings are reused. | `test_a_changed_config_invalidates_only_its_own_branch_and_downstream`, and the end-to-end example. |

The fourth row is the boundary result: because reconciliation reads no
topology, this unit has not absorbed graph scheduling authority, and the
architecture's rejection line 1 has not been crossed.

## Settled by user direction

- **Job lifetime is owner-bound.** Work must not outlive the caller that
  launched it. Detached execution is not wanted.
- **`bsub -J` and lookup by job name are available** at the target site.
- **Minimal local invocations must not pay for durability.** Recording is a
  declared property of work that leaves the process, not a tax on every call.
- **Interactive jobs are permitted at the target site**, so `bsub -I` is the
  direct mode.
- **Many similar jobs belong on a pooled `LSFCluster`**, not on many concurrent
  `-I` submissions.

## What can and cannot be reproduced without a farm

Splitting this honestly matters more than the totals, because "52 tests pass"
otherwise implies confidence the suite has not earned.

**Reproduced for real, locally:**

- The subprocess layer end to end, through a fake `bsub`/`bjobs`/`bkill` on
  PATH: argument construction, exit-status propagation, output capture,
  discovery, and cancellation all run the real `SubprocessRunner`.
- Our half of the owner-bound guarantee. `test_owner_bound.py` spawns a real
  child, `SIGKILL`s its owner, and asserts the child dies. This is genuine
  evidence about `PR_SET_PDEATHSIG`, and it covers the case a signal handler
  cannot and a lease could only bound.

**Not reproducible without LSF:**

- LSF's own interactive lifetime guarantee — that the job dies when the `bsub`
  client dies. This is IBM daemon behaviour, and the entire direct mode rests
  on it.
- Queue admission, scheduling, resource enforcement, and real `-W` termination.
- Whether the resource requirement we compose is *admitted*. Local tests fix
  the string we build — one `-R` holding whitespace-separated sections, with
  memory and licences in a single `rusage` — and can say nothing about whether
  the site parses it that way or knows those licence names.
  `lsf_preflight.py --licence <name>` submits one and reports.

There is no free LSF to run against. OpenLava was a CLI-compatible fork but is
unmaintained and legally clouded, so it is not a route we should take. A real
scheduler in a container (Slurm, where `srun` has the same client-bound shape as
`bsub -I`) could validate the *pattern* if the assumption ever looks doubtful;
it would be evidence by analogy, not about LSF.

`examples/lsf_preflight.py` closes the gap by deferring rather than pretending:
run it once on a submit host and it checks command availability, interactive
admission, `bjobs -J` lookup, and — the important one — whether a running job
actually disappears after its client is killed. If that check fails, the direct
mode's design premise is wrong and needs revisiting.

## Review findings and their resolution (2026-08-03)

An adversarial review at `xhigh` over the eight unpushed commits returned 15
findings; all are addressed. The distribution is the useful part: five in
`lsf.py`, none at all in `planned.py`, `reuse.py`, `identity.py`, or
`transport.py`.

That is not chance. `lsf.py` was written against a fake this unit also wrote,
from the same assumptions, so the fake agreed with the code's
misunderstandings — `discover()` returned a handle shaped unlike `submit()`'s,
and no test ever polled a discovered handle. The same pattern produced the
worst finding: `FakeBatchStore.accept()` reset its own run counter, so the
no-duplication assertions in the decisive failure injections could not fail,
and this ledger cited them as evidence. Where feedback came from outside — a
Plan document Hedloom Flow really produced, real process signals — the code was
clean.

**The standing lesson:** a fake authored alongside the code inherits its blind
spots. Prefer evidence from something the unit did not write.

## Open

- **Owner-bound enforcement — lease rejected, three layers proposed.** A
  bespoke lease file was proposed and rejected: it reinvents, badly, what the
  ecosystem already solves. Surveyed alternatives:

  - *Existing control connection.* `dask-jobqueue` workers exit after
    `death_timeout` (default 60s) when the scheduler is unreachable, and
    `cluster.close()` `bkill`s the jobs. Parsl's high-throughput executor does
    the same with manager-to-interchange heartbeats, and treats heartbeat
    timeout — not direct termination by the executor — as the intended way
    workers go away at shutdown. Effectively a lease, but carried on a channel
    that must exist anyway. Only applies when the remote process is our own
    agent, so it covers pooled mode and not one-`bsub`-per-task. Parsl's
    recurring heartbeat defects (managers evicted for missed heartbeats,
    scale-down broken by an over-aggressive result heartbeat) are the strongest
    argument against hand-rolling this: the mechanism is fiddly even for
    projects whose core competence it is.
  - *Plain batch commands.* Parsl's `LSFProvider` is just `bsub` to submit,
    `bjobs` for status, `bkill` to cancel — the same three primitives assumed
    here, with no lease of its own.
  - *Trap and kill.* Nextflow and Snakemake submit detached and cancel on
    signal. Reported failure modes are consistent: cancelling the controller's
    own cluster job orphans its children, SIGTERM frequently never reaches the
    job, and a backgrounded controller leaks its subtree. Best effort only.
  - *Batch walltime.* `bsub -W` lets LSF bound the job itself. Coarse, but
    unconditional, and the only layer that survives the owner losing power.

  **Accepted (2026-08-03, user direction): `bsub -I`, and none of the above.**
  The site permits interactive jobs, so LSF itself binds job lifetime to the
  submitting client and no lease, heartbeat, signal-trap layer, or reaper is
  needed. An earlier objection — that `-I` loses its guarantee outside an
  interactive session — was wrong: `-I` needs no terminal, blocks, and behaves
  identically under a script. The manifesto's rule about authority not living
  in an interactive session was also mis-applied; `-I` is a transport, while
  intent and records stay in files.

  The one real gap is local, not LSF's: `-I` binds the job to the `bsub` client,
  which is our child. If this process is killed outright the child would be
  reparented and keep the job alive. Closed by keeping the child in our process
  group and setting `PR_SET_PDEATHSIG` on Linux. `-W` is still mandatory as the
  one bound that survives everything else failing.

  Known costs, accepted: one process and one connection per concurrent job, no
  requeue, and output streaming rather than landing in job output files. The
  first is why many jobs go to a pool instead.
- **Orphan reaping.** Mostly obviated by `-I`: a job should not survive its
  owner, so a `bjobs -J` match means something already went wrong.
  `LSFInteractiveTransport.discover(...)` reports such a leftover but nothing
  acts on it automatically, and nothing should until a destructive `bkill` path
  has its own failure injection.
- **Pooled mode.** Accepted in principle for many similar invocations, where
  holding one process per job is the wrong shape. `LSFPooledTransport` is a
  refusing boundary; the implementation should adopt
  `dask_jobqueue.LSFCluster`, whose `death_timeout` and close-time `bkill`
  already give owner-bound worker lifetime. Not started; `dask-jobqueue` is not
  installed in this environment.
- **Cross-plan reuse.** Attempt identity includes `plan_id` and
  `invocation_id`, so two plans doing identical work each compute it. Dropping
  them would give a global content-addressed cache, which is more powerful and
  riskier: an undeclared-input error would then leak between studies rather
  than staying inside one. Deliberately conservative for now.
- **Reuse depends on stable invocation IDs.** Keyed calls have stable scoped
  IDs; unkeyed ones are authored-order and renumber when earlier work is
  inserted, silently discarding reuse. This makes Hedloom Flow's authored keys
  load-bearing for reuse, which was not their original purpose.
- **Verifying declared inputs.** Reuse trusts the author's declaration. Whether
  the unit should ever hash actual input files, rather than accept a supplied
  digest, is undecided — it would catch undeclared dependencies but requires
  owning address resolution, which belongs elsewhere.
- ~~**Who drives readiness.**~~ **Answered 2026-08-04 (user direction): Dask,
  via `hedloom_run.graph`.** One argument against it — that a blocking `bsub -I`
  would occupy a Dask worker slot — was retracted after measuring what
  `distributed.secede()` actually does; the register carries the retraction,
  the measurements, and what survives them.

  **Nothing in this unit changed, which is the point.** `hedloom-exec` imports no
  Dask, and the boundary result holds: reconciliation still reads no topology,
  so graph authority sits outside this unit no matter which kernel holds it.
  That neutrality is what made the adoption a driver change rather than a
  redesign, and it is what would make reversing it one too. Preserve it: a
  Dask import here would be the first thing to make the choice irreversible.
- **Retry lineage.** `sequence` exists in the identity and is otherwise unused.

## Would change our minds

- A workload that genuinely needs detached execution — an overnight sweep that
  should survive closing a laptop. That would reinstate the lifetime asymmetry
  for that mode only, and the demoted attach path exists so the change would be
  a transport capability rather than a redesign.
- A lease mechanism that cannot bound orphan lifetime under realistic network
  or filesystem failure. That would make owner-bound lifetime an unenforceable
  intent, and direct submission would need to be refused rather than trusted.
- Reconciliation needing to know which nodes were ready. That would mean the
  boundary is wrong and the engine question should be reopened.
- Result reuse proving unsound in practice because input identity cannot be
  captured honestly for simulator work. That would make rerun-everything the
  correct default and reduce the record to pure provenance.
