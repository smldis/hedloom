"""Check the assumptions this unit makes about LSF, on a real farm.

Everything here is unreproducible without a cluster, which is exactly why it is
a script you run rather than a test we pretend to pass. Run it once on a submit
host and read the report:

    python examples/lsf_preflight.py --queue normal

The last check is the important one. It verifies the assumption the whole
direct mode rests on: that killing the `bsub` client takes the job with it.
Nothing in the local test suite can establish that.
