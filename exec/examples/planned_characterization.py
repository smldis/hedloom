"""Author a flow, plan it, execute it, edit one input, and rerun.

This is the first end-to-end slice across both units: Hedloom Flow authors and
normalizes a static Plan, Hedloom Exec derives content-addressed bundles from that
Plan document and executes them with durable records.

The point of the demonstration is the second run. Change one corner's
temperature and rerun: that corner and the reduction downstream of it recompute,
the untouched corners are reused from their published manifests, and the
superseded result is still on disk and nameable rather than overwritten.

Run it from the unit directory with both source trees on the path:
