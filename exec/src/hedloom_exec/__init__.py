"""Hedloom Exec: durable attempt identity, evidence, and reconciliation.

This unit owns exactly one thing: the lifecycle of a single attempt at a single
planned invocation, from an identity chosen before submission through terminal
reconciliation. It owns no graph, decides no readiness, and releases no
successors.

Work launched here is owner-bound: it is not meant to outlive the caller that
started it. The durable record therefore exists for evidence and for skipping
work that is already validly done, not for reattaching to work still running
from a previous life. Recording is declared per invocation rather than charged
to every call — see `hedloom_exec.durability`.
