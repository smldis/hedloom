"""The attempt protocol: claim, attach, reconcile, or refuse to guess.

This module encodes the ownership hypothesis under test. The durable journal
owns attempt identity; the transport owns delivery; the substrate owns external
state after acceptance. No live object is treated as the authority for any of
them.

``launch_or_attach`` must resolve to exactly one of three dispositions, or fail
loudly. The failure is not a defect: an unrecoverable attempt is a real
property of a substrate that cannot answer questions about its own accepted
work, and reporting it beats acting blindly.

Under the current owner-bound lifetime decision, work is not meant to survive
its caller, so the ``attached`` disposition and ``UnrecoverableAttempt`` are
reachable only for a transport whose substrate keeps work after the submitter
dies. Nothing here does today. They are retained because the distinction they
encode — accepted, refused, or indeterminate — is exactly what an orphan-reaping
path needs in order to know whether there is anything to kill.

guessing in either direction is worse than not guessing. Caching an infrastructure
failure would poison an invocation permanently; discarding a real negative
