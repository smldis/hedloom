"""Attempt identities chosen before submission.

An attempt identity must exist *before* a transport is asked to accept work, so
that a submission whose receipt is lost can still be discovered afterwards. It
is therefore derived only from authored planning facts and an attempt sequence,
never from a transport handle, a process, or a wall-clock reading.

The rendered form is deliberately restricted to characters that survive use as
a batch job name, a filesystem directory, and an environment value.
