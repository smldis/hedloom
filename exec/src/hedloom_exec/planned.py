"""Derive execution bundles from an Hedloom Flow Plan document.

The coupling here is to the *document*, not to the package: a schema-2 Plan in
its plain-data form is a public, portable artifact, so this module reads
ordinary dictionaries and never imports `hedloom_flow`. Another producer of the
same document works equally well, and this unit's base distribution stays
dependency-free.

The invariant this module exists to hold:

    An invocation's input digest changes exactly when its own declaration or
    any ancestor's declaration changes.

That makes reuse transitive. Editing a source locator or one corner's
temperature invalidates that invocation and everything downstream of it, while
sibling branches keep their published results. It is a Merkle identity over the
plan, and it is the reason a rerun can honestly skip work.

Two things are deliberately absent. Nothing here runs, and nothing here decides
*when* an invocation should run: the returned order is a property the Plan
already has, not a scheduling decision. Choosing concurrency and readiness
remains outside this unit.
