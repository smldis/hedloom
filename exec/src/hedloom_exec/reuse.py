"""Input identity, sound reuse, and explaining what went stale.

Reuse is only honest if "already done" means "already done *with these
inputs*". This module derives a digest over the parts of a bundle that
determine its result, so that a changed input produces a different attempt
rather than a silently reused old one.

What participates is a real design decision, not an implementation detail:

* The operation, its command or arguments, its working directory, its declared
  input digests, and any environment explicitly nominated as identity-bearing.
* **Not** where or how the work ran. Queue, walltime, cores, and host do not
  change what a deterministic operation produces, so changing them must not
  invalidate a result. Placement is a scheduling concern; identity is a
  semantic one, and conflating them would make every resource tweak look like
  a new experiment.

An operation whose result depends on something outside this list — wall-clock
time, a mutable network resource, an undeclared file — is not honestly
reusable, and no digest can fix that. Declaring inputs is how an author makes
that promise explicit.
