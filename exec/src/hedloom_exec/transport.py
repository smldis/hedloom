"""The transport boundary: how one attempt reaches an execution substrate.

A transport moves one attempt to wherever it runs and reports what it observes
there. It is deliberately not allowed to decide which invocation is ready, to
release successors, or to own identity: those stay with the caller and with the
durable journal respectively.

``discovery_is_authoritative`` is the load-bearing declaration, and it is about
the *negative* answer only. Finding an accepted attempt is always usable
evidence: the identity was chosen before submission, so a match means the
substrate holds this exact work. Not finding one is the hard case — it may mean
the work was never accepted, or only that this substrate cannot be asked. A
transport that cannot distinguish those two must declare so, and the caller
must refuse to guess rather than risk a duplicate.
