"""What a run binds, independently of what decides when work runs.

A Plan declares meaning: operations, inputs, declared outputs, and the
placement each invocation resolved to. A *run* binds mechanism: which command
implements an operation, which substrate provides a placement, and which
address an upstream output actually landed at.

That binding is identical whether readiness is decided by a sequential loop or
by a Dask graph, so it lives here and both kernels use it. The invariant this
module exists to hold:

    Changing which kernel decides readiness changes how long a plan takes and
    nothing else — the same results, under the same identities.

Sharing the code is the strongest available guarantee of that. Two copies of
these rules would drift, and the drift would show up as a study that means
something different depending on how it was run.
