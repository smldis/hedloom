"""Walk a Plan and run it.

This is the piece that was missing while a Plan could be authored and a single
invocation could be executed, but nothing joined the two: the loop lived in an
example. It is deliberately its own unit, because deciding *when* work runs is
a different responsibility from owning one attempt's durable record, and
because the obvious alternative — letting Dask decide readiness — should be a
replacement for this unit rather than a rewrite of another.

What it owns: dependency order, readiness, threading each invocation's outputs
to the inputs that reference them, and what to do when something fails.

What it does not own: attempt identity, journals, transports, reuse (all
`hedloom_exec`), and the Plan itself (`hedloom_flow`). It also does not branch on
results. Every plan it can run was fully determined before it started, which is
what makes a rerun predictable; result-dependent control remains an open
architectural question rather than something smuggled in here.

    ``commands`` and ``outputs`` bind operations to how they actually run: a
    command line, and which files or streams count as its results. The Plan
    declares meaning; a run binds mechanism. Operations absent from both are
    executed in-process by the transport.

    ``transports`` maps a policy name to the substrate that provides it, so
    each invocation lands where its Plan says it should: one corner may take a
    dedicated LSF job while cheap reductions stay local. Passing a single
    ``transport`` instead provides every placement, which is convenient for a
    uniform run and wrong as soon as placements differ. A placement no
    transport provides is fatal, never a silent fallback.

    ``source_addresses`` locates each source the Plan declares, so an operation
    naming an external file as an input is handed it. Resolving an address is
    the caller's authority, never this unit's: omitting the mapping leaves such
    an input resolving to nothing, which is what every run did before.

    Work whose inputs are unchanged since a previous run is reused rather than
    repeated. On failure the default is to stop: successors are reported as
    ``blocked`` rather than run against inputs that do not exist.
