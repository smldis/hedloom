"""Readiness owned by Dask; placement still owned by the Plan.

One task per invocation, edges where one invocation's output feeds another's
input. Dask decides what is ready and how much runs at once; it does not decide
where anything runs, what an attempt's identity is, or whether work may be
reused — those stay with the Plan and with `hedloom_exec`, exactly as they were
under the sequential driver.

The invariant this kernel must not break:

    Changing which kernel decides readiness changes how long a plan takes and
    nothing else — the same results, under the same identities.

The binding rules it obeys are therefore imported from `hedloom_run.binding` rather
than restated here.

**Cluster shape matters, and the recommended one is unusual.** Use a local,
threaded cluster on the submit host:

    from distributed import Client, LocalCluster
    cluster = LocalCluster(processes=False, threads_per_worker=32)

Three measured reasons, recorded in `docs/vision/open-concepts.md`:

* An invocation waiting on `bsub -I` costs about 16 KiB of thread and one
  client process. Concurrency here is a safety rail, not a scarce resource, and
  `threads_per_worker` *is* the rail — there is deliberately no limit parameter
  in this module. Size it from the site's MAX JOB policy and per-user process
  limits, which are facts to ask for rather than guess.
* Nothing secedes. A worker holding live `bsub -I` clients should read as
  running, and `secede()` would report it idle by excluding the task from the
  parallelism count.
* Threads avoid supervision and duplication, not serialization. A nanny that
  restarts a worker under memory pressure would take that worker's blocked
  clients with it — and, under owner-bound lifetime, that many running farm
  jobs. Measured, though, and worth knowing: Dask serializes every task even on
  an in-process cluster, so a **transport always travels as a copy**, never as
  a shared live object. Ours are effectively stateless per submission, so a
  copy is correct. A transport that must be a singleton — a pooled one holding
  a client to a second cluster — cannot be passed this way and will need a
  factory constructed on the worker.

A failed invocation blocks its dependents by returning a blocked outcome, not
by raising. Independent branches continue: one corner failing does not abandon
the other forty-nine, which is what a sweep wants and what the sequential
driver could not offer.
