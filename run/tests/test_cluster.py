"""What a site exposes, and the promise that the default exposes what it did.

Two tests carry this module. `test_a_silent_cluster_holds_no_http_server` is
the one the feature exists for, and it asserts a behaviour rather than an
internal: if a future `distributed` moves the seam this module suppresses, the
failure names a cluster that opened a server, not a missing attribute.

`test_the_network_exposure_asks_dask_for_nothing` is the one that protects
every existing installation. `"network"` must pass no address at all, because
the moment it names one it has taken over a default that belongs to Dask.
