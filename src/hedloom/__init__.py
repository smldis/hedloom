"""Author a study, inspect what it will do, and run it — from one import.

    from hedloom import operation, flow, plan, file, shell, lsf, Site, study

Everything here already existed in three units; what was missing was the seam
that let one file be a whole study. `hedloom_flow` still owns authoring and the
Plan, `hedloom_exec` still owns one attempt's durable record and imports neither
this package nor Dask, and `hedloom_run` still owns binding and readiness. This
package composes them and adds the one thing none of them could own alone: a
`submit` that runs what was authored, because it holds both halves.

The operation decorator here is `hedloom_flow`'s, wrapped so the body it already
kept is remembered as something callable. That is the whole difference. Before
it, `@operation` bodies were dead code and every study needed a second file to
supply real implementations — for the OTA reference, six hundred lines whose
only job was to agree with the first file.
