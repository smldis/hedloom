"""Running the bodies a Plan names.

Until now an operation body was dead code: `@operation` kept the function and
nothing ever called it, so every study needed a second file supplying real
implementations, command lines, and output paths — for the OTA reference, six
hundred lines of them. The Plan could say what it meant and not what it would
do.

This module closes that. A bound transport takes the operations a study
authored, and when the executor asks it to run an invocation it calls the body
with the inputs the Plan resolved and an `out` namespace addressing that
attempt's own workspace.

The invariant:

    A body decides what runs; it never decides *whether* it runs.

Reuse, identity, ordering and placement are settled before a body is called,
so an author cannot accidentally acquire scheduling authority by writing
Python. A body that returns a `Shell` is a launcher: the command it built is
handed to the substrate its placement names, which is how one corner becomes
one `bsub -I` job while the launcher itself costs nothing.
