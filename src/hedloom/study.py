"""A study: one object that can show you its Plan and then run it.

The two halves of this system were always joined by hand. An author wrote a
Plan; someone else wrote a binding supplying implementations, commands, output
paths, transports and roots; a third caller walked the result. Each seam was a
place where the study could mean something different from what was authored.

`submit()` joins them. It is deliberately not a new capability: it materializes
the same Plan, binds the same operations, and calls the same kernel. What it
removes is the opportunity to bind them inconsistently.

The invariant:

    Nothing is spent until `submit`, and what runs is what the Plan showed.

`study.plan` is complete and inspectable before submission — the manifesto's
requirement to materialize jobs before spending simulation resources — and the
operations that run are the ones the Plan names, because both come from the
same declaration rather than from two files that must agree.
