"""Looking at a study before running it.

`hedloom_flow.experimental.local_dask` lowers a Plan to Dask `Delayed` values. It
was written as an instrument and left unreexported, because lowering a Plan to
a second execution path is exactly the kind of thing that quietly becomes a
second way to run work. It is still not that. This module gives it the one use
that needs no execution at all: a picture.

The distinction is kept by construction. Lowering here binds every operation to
a stand-in that **refuses to run**, so the graph can be drawn, walked, and
counted, and computing it raises rather than producing a number nobody
simulated. Computing one surfaces as the lowerer's own
`InvocationExecutionError`, naming the invocation, with `RefusedComputation` as
its cause. `submit()` remains the only way a study runs.

Three views, because they answer different questions:

* `render(...)` draws the Plan in the vocabulary it was authored in: one node
  per invocation, labelled with its authored key. It scales to whatever holds
  it, and lays out tall or wide on request, so one file reads on a monitor and
  on a phone.
* `render(..., view="dask")` draws the lowering instead — task keys, source
  thunks, output projections. What a scheduler would see, and not somewhere a
  corner can be found by name.
* `structure(...)` returns the same authored view as plain nodes and edges, for
  a renderer that has neither graphviz nor Dask.
